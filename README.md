# Mori

There are many Growtopia companion tools available, but almost all of them are Windows-only, and I'm here to change that. Instead of being a GUI-focused app, I want to do something creative. This will be compiled as a **CLI** program, and it will open a port that you can use to preview the bots in your favorite browser, including their location in the world, manipulating location, and more. This is programmed in **Rust**, ensuring high performance and safety.

‚≠ê **Star** this project if you're interested in its journey!  
Any **contribution** would help a lot.
